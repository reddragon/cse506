Challenge Problem:
The problem of printing colored text on the console was solved.

The cga_putc function ORs the value 0x0700 with the character.
The most-significant byte contains character color data. The
most-significant four bits from 15-12 contain data about the
background and the next four bits from 11-8 contain the 
foreground color. 

When the text-color needs to be set, one can call the 
cga_setcolor(foreground_color, background_color) function. 
The colors are defined as macros in kern/console.h. This sets
the value of color_mask in kern/console.c, which is ORed with
the character in cga_putc.

The monitor command 'debug' is used to demonstrate this.
